\cvsection{cvcolor1}{Pacifico-Regular}{Personal Statement}
I have studied in computer engineering because I find a great interest in development creativity and computing projects. I lead a small personnal watch about new techniques of programming and software innovation.
In addition of a fond facination of the independent cinema and the electronic music, I contribute to a development team during my free time on \href{https://github.com/team-chiru}{\textit{GitHub}} and I try to do my best for making music and video.
As far as I have a good health (and I do all to maintain it), I am modivated, a little bit perfectionnist and a very bad joker.
